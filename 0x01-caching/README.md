# 0x01. Caching

Caching is a technique used in programming to temporarily store data in a faster-to-access location, so that it can be retrieved more quickly the next time it is needed. This can help to improve the performance of a program by reducing the amount of time it takes to access frequently used data. Caching can be implemented in various ways, such as storing data in memory or on disk, and can be used at different levels of a program, such as at the application or system level.

## Description
What i learnt in this project:

```
* What a caching system is
* What FIFO means
* What LIFO means
* What LRU means
* What MRU means
* What LFU means
* What the purpose of a caching system
* What limits a caching system have
```
